			<td>two different tillage regimes; conventional tillage (CT) and reduced tillage/mustard cover crop (RT–CC). With CT, the residue (≈3 tonnes ha−1) from the previous season's crop was left undisturbed over the autumn and winter period. Herbicide (glyphosate 3 l ha−1 of a 360 g product) was applied in January or early February to control over-wintering weeds and volunteer barley seedlings. The soil was inverted by ploughing to a depth of approximately 220 mm, generally in February or early March (depending on weather and soil conditions) from one to five weeks prior to sowing the crop (Table 1). The RT–CC management system began with a shallow (approx. 75 mm) non-inversion cultivation involving one passwith a tined stubble cultivator (Horsch Terrano FX) from mid to late August followed by rolling to encourage moisture conservation and volunteer growth (Table 1). Following a period of two to three weeks, the area was sprayed with glyphosate (1.08 kg ha−1) and the mustard cover crop (cv. ‘Rivona’ in 2008 and 2009; ‘Sunshine’ in 2010) was sown two days later using a cultivator drill (Vaderstad Rapide) at a seeding rate of 13 kg ha−1. The cover crop was sprayed with glyphosate herbicide in January to early February to ensure the vegetation had sufficient time to decay before sowing the spring barley crop. Both CT and RT–CC plots were sown with spring barley in March with a cultivator drill (Vaderstad Rapide) — the exact date depending on weather conditions and soil moisture content. The CT plots were rolled prior to sowing and all plots were rolled after sowing (Table 1). Phosphorus and potassium fertilizers were applied in accordance with recommendations based on soil nutrient status (Coulter and Lalor, 2008). Fertilizer N was applied at a rate of 63 kg N ha−1 at growth stage 12 (GS: Zadoks decimal scale), and subsequently another 72 kg N ha−1 was applied at GS 21–30, to give a total of 135 kg N ha−1 (Table 1). A fungal disease control programme consisting of two applications of a triazole broad-spectrum fungicide was applied each season when the crop was at growth stages 31 and 39. A weed control programme including broad leaf and grass-weed selective herbicides (mecoprop and iodosulfuron–methyl–sodium) was necessary because of grass growth in the RT–CC plots. Crops were harvested in August of each year when the grain moisture content was approximately 200 g kg−1</td>

 and H2O concentrations, respectively. The measurements were taken
 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 13, 19, 22, 30, 37, and 55
 days after tillage. First the measurements of
 soil CO2 emissions were taken five minutes
 after tillage. Nine records were taken on the
 same randomly selected points from every plot
 for each measurement.The trial was completed
 when CO2 emission reached contant level. In
 addition, evaporation (H2O emissions) and soil
 temperature were concomitantly measured.</td>
			<td>End date for this experiment is unclear, as they have two potential start dates (June 3 and July 26th 2010) though it reads as 1 overall experiment. End dates could possibly be July or September following the 55 day period in which they took measurements.</td>

This resulted in four treatments (Table 1), each replicated eight times. Plots were 6 × 15 m in size. Four uncultivated control plots (two zero-tillage (ZTcontrol) and two conventional tillage (CT control)) were established adjacent to each side of the main experimental blocks. These plots were estab- lished to enable ‘background’ N2O emissions and soil N dynamics to be determined from unamended and uncropped soil.
All treatments, except controls, received 6 t ha−1 of wheat straw (Triticum aestivum) from the previous crop on 26 May 1999. This straw was incorporated to 25 cm depth in the CT treatments and surface mulched in the ZT treatments. </td>

 constructed from PVC pipe (20 cm diameter x 16 cm headspace). Chambers were fitted at
 the top with a vent (5 mm diameter x 25 cm length), and a sampling port. Chambers were
 colored white to minimize temperature variation of air within the chambers. Four chambers
 were randomly placed 3 cm into the soil within each plot</td>
			<td>Using a syringe, gas samples were
 collected from the chamber headspace at 0,30,60 minute intervals, and stored in 3 ml vials.
 Vials were then stored at 4°C until analysis. Gas samples were analyzed using a Varian star
 cx gas chromatograph (Varian, Walnut Creek, CA). Nitrous oxide concentrations were
 determined using a 4 m Haysep R column, and a 63Ni electron capture detector (ECD). Methane concentration was determined using a 3 m Porapak N column, and a flame ionizing
 detector (FID).</td>

			<td>Crop residues for the decomposition study were
 collected after the harvest of the grain crops or the
 management of the cover crops (wheat, black oat, black oat + vetch, soybean, maize). These crop residues
 were chopped in 0.05 m pieces and dried at 65 oC to
 constant weight. The mesh-bags (0.10 x 0.20 m) were
 made of a 50 μm screen to allow access of soil mesoand
 macro-fauna (Amado et al., 2003; Padovan et al.,
 2006). In the first evaluation period (1998/1999), the
 mesh-bags were filled with an equal amount of crop
 residues for all treatments. In the second period (1999
 and 1999/2000), the amount of crop residues placed
 in the mesh-bags was proportional to the amount of
 dry biomass produced in each plot. Six mesh-bags
 were placed per plot on the soil surface in NT (no tillage) and at
 a depth of 0.10 m in the CT (conventional tillage). All applied to three cropping systems (R0: soybean/wheat; R1: soybean/wheat/soybean/black oat; R2:

 the chamber. The chambers (270 mm in diameter and 100 mm in

			<td>On annual basis, the conventional management system received 856.8 kg ha−1 of NPK (15-10-15). This dose was split in three appli- cations as follows: 55.1 kg ha−1 of N as NH4NO3, 36.7 kg ha−1 of P2O5 as triple superphosphate and 55.1 kg ha−1 of K2O as KCl in the first application; and in the second and third applications, 36.7 kg ha−1 of N as NH4NO3, 24.5 kg ha−1 of P2O5 as triple superphosphate and 36.7 kg ha−1 of K2O as KCl. Following the same fertilizer doses, chambers allocated at fertilized areas (canopy projection) received manually on the first fertilizer application 0.78 g of N-NH4NO3, 0.52 g of P2O5 and 0.78g of K2O. On the second application, the same chambers received 0.52 g of N-NH4NO3, 0.35 g of P2O5 and 0.52 of K2O.
 Organic managed orchards received 12 Mg ha− 1 year− 1 of fertilizer containing 78.8% poultry litter, 19.7% clay peat and 1.5% ulexite. This fertilizer amount was split in three doses of 4 Mg ha−1 each. Organic fertilizer contained 3.84% N and 28.5% C, which led to an annual input of 376 kg N ha−1 and 2742 kg C ha−1. According to the fertilizer sup- plier and literature (Tyson and Cabrera, 1993), the organic fertilizer has a short-term N availability equivalent to about 30%. Therefore, the supply of N for the crop was assumed to be similar in the organic and the conventional management systems. Chambers at the canopy pro- jection received 56.5 g of organic fertilizer on both the first and second applications of fertilizer.</td>

			<td>C-CO2, C-CH4 and N-N2O emissions from soil were measured using the chamber-based method (Varner et al., 2003) between September 2012 and March 2013. We used an intensive monitoring approach, resulting in 65 and 70 sampling events in the organic and conventional managements, respectively. Two fertilizer applications were covered during this period, following the farm management routine. In each site, 4 cylindrical PVC bases (30 cm in diameter, 22 cm in height) were installed under the canopy of trees, which is the fertilized area of the orchard; additionally, two other chambers were installed at the mid- row position. Emissions from chambers at unfertilized positions were used to calculate the direct N-N2O emissions from chambers with fer- tilizers.
 All samplings were performed between 7:00 and 12:00 a.m. After closing the chambers, 60-mL samples were collected at 1, 10, 20 and 30 min using syringes and stored under pressure in 20-mL evacuated penicillin flasks sealed with gas-impermeable butyl-rubber septa.</td>

 method, modified from Anderson (1982). A plastic
 receptacle containing 10 mL of 1N NaOH was attached
 inside each chamber, to trap the evolved CO2; the
 chambers were buried at approximately 5-cm depth, six
 per replicate plot. If plant residues were present on the
 soil surface, they were kept inside the chambers. For
 each sampling time, three out of the six chambers were
 closed with a PVC cap and sealed with a rubber ring to
 prevent CO2 losses.</td>

 indirectly determined after the addition of saturated BaCl2 to the NaOH solution, followed by the titration of
 the non-consumed NaOH with HCl, and values were
 expressed as g of CO2–C m2 day1.</td>

 back titration against a standardised HC1 solution

 CO2 evolution was then calculated as g CO2 emitted/

These plots were seeded with rapeseed in September 1996. Fertilizers were applied in solid form as: NH4NO3 (T1), (NH4)2SO4 (T2), CO(NH2)2 (T3) and KNO3 (T4) on 3 March at a dose of 100 kg N ha–1, and on 18 March at a dose of 70 kg N ha–1. This latter fertilization application was completed with additional MgSO4 (75 kg S ha–1) in the T1, T3 and T4 treatments to equili- brate the SO42– addition of the four treatments. Two other treat- ments were plots seeded with wheat in October 1996. N fertilizers were applied as NH4NO3 with added MgSO4 (75 kg S ha–1) under the conditions of rapeseed cultivation i.e. on 3 March at a dose of 100 kg N ha–1 and 18 March at a dose of 70 kg N ha–1 (treatment: T5) and as NH4NO3 with added MgSO4 (75 kg S ha–1) under con- ditions more adapted to wheat cultivation with attention to plant development i.e. on 3 March at a dose of 80 kg N ha–1 and on 8 April at a dose of 80 kg N ha–1 (treatment: T6).

			<td>Organic or conventionalfarming systems were established as main plots with four randomlyallocated plots per system. Each plot was divided into two subplotsirrigated either with good-quality or with salt-enriched water con-taining either 0.5 or 10 mM NaCl, respectively. Thus the experiment,which was a split-plot design, included a total of 16 experimentalunits.Seeds were sown at a depth of 3 cm. Plant spacing betweenand within rows of common bean was 50 cm, giving a densityof 80,000 plants ha−1. Each subplot corresponded to a net culti-vated area of 60 m2. Beans were sown on 30 April 2011 and thecrop was harvested on 30 July 2011. Management of the organicfarming plots was based on the principle that organic croppingsystems should minimize the use of external inputs, includingN fertilizers, avoiding the use of synthetic fertilizers (Scialabbaand Hattam, 2002). A cropping system is correctly evaluated byaltering the whole system rather than individual parameters andlooking at the combined effect of this change. Accordingly, fer-tilization practices differing in both the level and the form ofthe fertilizers were applied in the organic and conventional plots.Thus, in the conventionally treated plots, a synthetic inorganicfertilizer was applied as base dressing before sowing at a rateof 120 kg ha−1N, 160 kg ha−1P2O5, and 160 kg ha−1K2O, follow-ing standard recommendations for conventional field-grown beancrops. In the organically managed plots, an organic fertilizer pro-duced by compressing composted crop residues was applied beforesowing, which provided an equivalent of 25 kg ha−1N, 175 kg ha−1P2O5, and 250 kg ha−1K2O, following common practices of localorganic growers. Synthetic pesticides were not used either in theconventionally or in the organically managed plots. The plants wereirrigated through a drip irrigation system equipped with one drip-per per plant.</td>

			<td>Two types of non- steady state portable chambers that cover the soil surface only (no plants) were used in the field. Insulated stainless steel chambers that moved from plot to plot and covered 0.012 m2 of soil surface were used from September 2003 through April 2004. In May 2004, 0.051-m2 PVC rings were installed in the field. The rings were pushed approximately 5 cm into the soil and left in place at positions in the middle of the seed bed, middle of the furrow, over the crop row between plants (when applicable), and over the side dressed band of fertilizer-N (Fig. 2). Portable PVC end caps were converted into chamber lids and were placed on top of the rings for sampling. In addition, two 0.62-m2 auto-chambers were installed in the ST field with the capability of assessing the temporal pattern of CO2 flux, and one auto-chamber was installed in the MT field. For the temporal pattern of N2O flux, 24-h flux measurements were made in August 2005.</td>

Preliminary tests under field conditions showed that N2O flux remained linear for the first 20 min following deployment. Thus, we sampled N2O from the vented chambers in nylon syringes after 20 min. In 2003–2004, samples were kept in the sealed syringes and analyzed within 24 h on a Hewlett Packard 6890 series gas chromatograph (GC). In 2005–2006, samples pulled from the chambers were injected into pre-evacuated, 5.9- mL exetainers in the field and analyzed on the GC within a week. In addition, measurements of NO flux were made using a chemilu- minescent NOx (NO + NO2) analyzer (Unisearch Model LMA-3), at least monthly from April to August 2004. Concentrations of NO gas were recorded at 30 s intervals for 4–5 min after placement of the chamber top (Venterea and Rolston, 2000).</td>

 diameter of 20 cm and a height of 25 cm. The top round edges
 were rubber-sealed in order to prevent from leakage when the
 top lid was put on it. No vent was installed in the chamber.
 Two battery-operated fans inside the stainless steel box
 homogenized the air in the chamber. A white thermal
 insulation cover was added outside of the stainless steel cover
 to reduce the impact of direct radiative heating during
 sampling. During the experimental period,
 the chambers were placed on stainless steel frame that had
 been inserted 5 cm into the soil. After the insertion of
 chamber in the soil for 20 min, 500 ml gas samples were
 collected using a 50 ml gas-tight polypropylene syringe
 through a rubber tube attached to the top of the chamber and
 then injected into evacuated bags made of inert
 aluminum-coated plastic.</td>

The 2% composites were not used due to constraints on the number of plots that could be sampled in a timely fashion. An additional control treatment to which no N fertilizer was added resulted in seven fertilizer treatments. Description: Urea ((NH2)2CO, Synth), montmorillonite clay without puriﬁcation (Bentonita, Drescon S/A, Produtos de Perfuração), and polycaprolactone (PCL) or polyacrylamide hydrogel (HG) were used as components of the nanocomposites. Clay material (average particle size of 230 nm) was used as received. Urea and PCL were previously ground in a hammer mill (Tecnal, TE-330) and in a cryogenic milling apparatus, respectively. The HG was synthesized in the lab, based on the methodology described in previous work.14 HG was obtained by chemical polymerization of the acrylamide monomer in aqueous solution of the MMT. For synthesis, we used a constant mass ratio of monomer (acrylamide) to clay of 1:1. After drying, the HG was ground in a ball mill (SERVITECH, CT 242) and sifted through a 45 mesh sieve (0.35 mm openings). MMT was introduced into the HG matrix to improve the mechanical properties and to increase the degree of mixing between the components during mixing with urea in ﬁnal composite preparation</td>

For the CT plots we applied one heavy disking operation (∼15 cm deep) and two leveling disking operations (∼10 cm deep) in spring to incorporate ryegrass biomass before planting maize and again in autumn before sowing ryegrass. We used a heavy disker equipped with 25 inch diameter disks that produced similar effects to ploughing (i.e., a layer cut and inversion, residue incorporation and formation of a compacted pan below the tilled layer). In southern Brazil, this CT management system based on heavy disking up to 15 cm deep represents about 70 % of the area in which soil is tilled. For the NT plots, the ryegrass cover crop was desiccated with a glyphosate-based herbicide, equivalent to adding glyphosate at the rate of 1,200 gha−1, before planting maize, the same herbicide regime being used to desiccate spontaneous weeds before sowing the ryegrass. The NT systems in this region still depend on the application of herbicide. The NT management implies no tillage operation over the years. Since treatments were based on an annual succession of oat/ maize, the cropping system and farm operations were repeated every other year for each treatment.</td>

			<td>Static chambers consisting of sections of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe (16 cm diameter, 16 cm height) with one end threaded to attach to a cap were used to measure [N.sub.2]O emissions. However, in the early part of Trials 1 and 2, GHGs were measured using an automated GHG system that measured the gas in each chamber (50 cm x 50 cm x 15 cm) eight times daily, as described in Scheer et al. (2014). This provided a 24-h emission profile during this period, which was switched to manual chambers after approximately 2.5 weeks. The automatic chambers were placed between the two celery rows that completely covered the areas treated with either manure or fertiliser to ensure representative emissions. Manual chambers were driven into the ground to a depth of 8 cm, leaving a headspace height of 8 cm. In Trials 1 and 2, one chamber was used in each experimental plot, but in Trial 3 two chambers were used, one within the treated area and one outside the treated area. A single chamber was inserted between the plant rows in an area of soil that was treated with manure or fertiliser in all trials. In Trial 3, there was an additional chamber outside the fertiliser-treated area (within the plant row) in each plot. Chambers were capped with a threaded PVC lid that had a rubber O-ring to form an airtight seal and a 13-mm rubber septum fitted into the cap for gas sampling. On each sampling occasion, three gas samples were extracted from chambers at fixed intervals (0, 20 and 40 min) after chamber closure by inserting a needle into the septum in the chamber cap and withdrawing a 20-mL gas sample with a syringe.</td>
			<td>Gas samples were subsequently analysed for N2O and CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (GC-2014; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) in the laboratory, and the emission fluxes were determined from the linear increase in the concentration of the gas over the closure period correcting for air temperature and atmospheric pressure (Scheer et al. 2014)</td>

Additionally, snow samples from the soil surface and from a polyethylene foil covering a 3 m2 soil area were taken in air-tight jars (1 l, n = 5), respectively. The N2O absorbed in this snow was released by melting the snow (24VC). Gas samples from the headspace were taken after an equilibration period of 24 h.

			<td>The fertiliser treatments were:
1. Zero nitrogen fertiliser (0N) – i.e. no added fertiliser.
2. Conventional (CONV) - 100 kg N-1 ha-1 total application. 54 kg N-1 ha-1 Nitrophoska® basal application at planting (7th May) and 46kg N-1 ha-1 Urea in one application as a side dressing (14th June). 
3. Nitrification inhibitor (DMPP) - 100 kg N-1 ha-1 total application ; with addition of nitrification inhibitor DMPP (trade name Entec®). 54 kg N-1 ha-1 (as Nitrophoska Entec®) basal application at planting (7th May) and 46kg N-1 ha-1 Urea (as Entec®) in one application as a side dressing (14th June).

The fertiliser rate of 100kg-N ha-1 and application in two split doses was based on a standard rate of nitrogen application for lettuce and followed “good agricultural practice” for the Lockyer Valley (Heisswolf et al. 1997). Basal fertiliser treatments were applied by hand ensuring even application over each plot and incorporated using a rotary hoe just prior to transplanting lettuce seedlings.
The plots were irrigated with bore water using a hand-shift sprinkler irrigation system. Irrigation was applied during times with low wind speeds to assure uniformity of application. Irrigation amounts were measured using a rain gauge installed at the centre of each plot and aimed at replacing evapotranspiration. Irrigation was scheduled on a weekly basis, except when sufficient rain had fallen in the previous week.</td>

Fluxes of N2O from the automated chambers were calculated from the slope of the linear increase or decrease over the 4 concentrations measured over the closure time similar to the procedure outlined by (Scheer et al., 2014).</td>

Soybean grown within the irrigated treatment was irrigated on an as-needed basis [6], while the dryland soybean was only rain fed. Soybean harvest generally occurred between late October and the middle of November each year. Following soybean harvest, wheat was drill-seeded with 19-cm row spac- ing [19]. Since 2005, wheat grown within the high-fertility treatment was fertilized with a split application of urea (i.e., 56kgNha−1 applied in early March and 56kgNha−1 in late March), while a low-fertility treatment received no N applications. In early-to-mid-June each year, wheat was harvested and the remaining stubble was mowed with a rotary mower to create a uniform layer of residue. After mowing and prior to tillage, a residue burning treatment was imposed each year.</td>

For spring barley, in order to ensure the crop N optima were reached, N application rates were 0 kg N ha-1, 60%, 120%, 180% and 240% of the recommended N rate. Following recommended practice (Anon., 2000; Anon., 2010; Sinclair et al., 2009) and depending on the crop type, up to three separate fertiliser applications were made in order to reach the targeted application rates. So that the experiments were as commercially relevant to the UK agricultural industry as possible, the amount of N fertiliser applied at each application timing also followed recommended practice for that rate and that crop (Anon., 2000; Anon., 2010) such that across the four fertilised treatments, at each split, the N applied was seldom linearly proportional to the final application rates. To prevent any nutrient deficiencies, overall basal phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and sulphur were applied according to site requirements following soil analysis, and applications of agro-chemicals were made as required to control weeds, pests, diseases and lodging. Following crop harvest, cereal straw was chopped and returned to the soil, or baled and removed, reflecting the commercial practice in each area.

So that the experiments were as commercially relevant to the UK agricultural industry as possible, the amount of N fertiliser applied at each application timing also followed recommended practice for that rate and that crop (Anon., 2000; Anon., 2010) such that across the four fertilised treatments, at each split, the N applied was seldom linearly proportional to the final application rates. To prevent any nutrient deficiencies, overall basal phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and sulphur were applied according to site requirements following soil analysis, and applications of agro-chemicals were made as required to control weeds, pests, diseases and lodging. Following crop harvest, cereal straw was chopped and returned to the soil, or baled and removed, reflecting the commercial practice in each area.

So that the experiments were as commercially relevant to the UK agricultural industry as possible, the amount of N fertiliser applied at each application timing also followed recommended practice for that rate and that crop (Anon., 2000; Anon., 2010) such that across the four fertilised treatments, at each split, the N applied was seldom linearly proportional to the final application rates. To prevent any nutrient deficiencies, overall basal phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and sulphur were applied according to site requirements following soil analysis, and applications of agro-chemicals were made as required to control weeds, pests, diseases and lodging. Following crop harvest, cereal straw was chopped and returned to the soil, or baled and removed, reflecting the commercial practice in each area.

For spring barley, in order to ensure the crop N optima were reached, N application rates were 0 kg N ha-1, 60%, 120%, 180% and 240% of the recommended N rate. Following recommended practice (Anon., 2000; Anon., 2010; Sinclair et al., 2009) and depending on the crop type, up to three separate fertiliser applications were made in order to reach the targeted application rates. So that the experiments were as commercially relevant to the UK agricultural industry as possible, the amount of N fertiliser applied at each application timing also followed recommended practice for that rate and that crop (Anon., 2000; Anon., 2010) such that across the four fertilised treatments, at each split, the N applied was seldom linearly proportional to the final application rates. To prevent any nutrient deficiencies, overall basal phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and sulphur were applied according to site requirements following soil analysis, and applications of agro-chemicals were made as required to control weeds, pests, diseases and lodging. Following crop harvest, cereal straw was chopped and returned to the soil, or baled and removed, reflecting the commercial practice in each area. Cropping practices after harvest were typical of the crop rotation in each area.</td>

For spring barley, in order to ensure the crop N optima were reached, N application rates were 0 kg N ha-1, 60%, 120%, 180% and 240% of the recommended N rate. Following recommended practice (Anon., 2000; Anon., 2010; Sinclair et al., 2009) and depending on the crop type, up to three separate fertiliser applications were made in order to reach the targeted application rates. So that the experiments were as commercially relevant to the UK agricultural industry as possible, the amount of N fertiliser applied at each application timing also followed recommended practice for that rate and that crop (Anon., 2000; Anon., 2010) such that across the four fertilised treatments, at each split, the N applied was seldom linearly proportional to the final application rates. To prevent any nutrient deficiencies, overall basal phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and sulphur were applied according to site requirements following soil analysis, and applications of agro-chemicals were made as required to control weeds, pests, diseases and lodging. Following crop harvest, cereal straw was chopped and returned to the soil, or baled and removed, reflecting the commercial practice in each area. Cropping practices after harvest were typical of the crop rotation in each area.</td>

The gas chromatographs were calibrated on a daily basis using certified N2O standard gas mixtures. The gas chromatographs used in this project were also involved in inter-laboratory ring tests to ensure the comparability of data reported by different labs. In order to permit sampling from a growing crop, at the time of sampling an additional chamber was stacked (using the water-filled channel) onto each permanent chamber and the chamber enclosure period extended.</td>

Haplustept loamy skeletal (Soil Survey Staff 2010), typical of soils used for dairy winter
forage grazing in the Canterbury region, South Island of New Zealand, was used in this
study. Developed from gravelly glacial outwash alluvium and loess, the Balmoral soil
consists of a thin, sandy silt loam topsoil containing about 30% stones. Below the
topsoil, the stone and sand content increases substantially, making this soil very free draining.
Prior to collecting the lysimeters, the soil at the site had key properties as follows: pH
5.9, Olsen P 24 mg kg−1, K+0.86cmol+

			<td>Lysimeters were collected during December 2010, using the method described by
Cameron et al. (1992). Briefly, steel casings (50 cm diameter × 70 cm depth) were pushed
into the soil in small increments, while the surrounding soil was gently scraped away,
leaving an undisturbed soil column within the casing. The edges of the soil column were sealed to the casing using molten petroleumjelly, to prevent edge flow effects. The lysimeters
were then installed in a lysimeter facility, level with the surrounding soil. The outside of the
lysimeters were back-filled to maintain the climatic conditions of the surrounding field.
The lysimeters were planted with the fodder crop kale (Brassica oleracea cv. Regal L.) in
January 2011. After germination, the kale plants were thinned to a similar density to that
found in a winter forage grazing system. Irrigation was supplied during the summer
months at a rate of 15 mm every 3 days. At the time of sowing, a fertiliser mix containing
phosphorus (5.5%), potassium (14.7%), sulphur (13.2%), calcium (12.4%), boron (0.37%)
and molybdenum (0.02%) was applied to each lysimeter at a rate equivalent to 1600 kg
ha−1. Lime, at a rate equivalent to 2500 kg ha−1, was also applied at the time of sowing.
The kale was allowed to reach maturity and was harvested in June 2011, prior to applying
the treatments to the lysimeters.</td>

(UDB). A control (C) was used to provide background N2O emission data. All treatments,
including the control, were replicated four times. Following harvest of the kale, the soil was
wetted to field capacity by adding 10 mm of simulated rainfall. The UB and UDB
treatment lysimeters were amended with biochar (Pacific Pyrolysis, Table 1) at the rate
of 5 t ha−1, which was incorporated into the top 5 cm of the soil using hand implements
to minimise soil disturbance. The soil in all lysimeters was then trampled using cow hoof
simulation equipment designed to provide approximately 200 kPa—similar to the
pressure exerted by an adult cow hoof (Di et al. 2001). The surface of the soil was completely
trampled twice, to simulate the heavy grazing typical under forage crops. The
heavy trampling ensured the biochar was well mixed into the top 5 cm of soil, and an
equal degree of soil disturbance between all treatments. DCD was dissolved in water
and applied to the UD and UDB treatment lysimeters at a rate equivalent to 20 kg
ha−1, a rate at which preliminary work had shown to be effective in the free-draining,
urine-amended soil. Fresh urine was collected from non-lactating dairy cows that were
feeding on kale, and analysed for total N concentration. The urine was standardised to 7.0 g N L−1 and applied to all lysimeters, except the controls, at a rate equivalent to 700 kg
N ha−1. The controls received an equivalent volume of water.</td>

non-trafficked beds, but for the purposes of this experiment an additional
“random” wheeltrack was imposed on the permanent crop beds to mimic
traffic impact in non-controlled (random) traffic farming. This was installed
during the seeding operation, when growers were asked to make a single
tractor and seeder unit pass along a 50 m length of crop bed, 0.8-1.0 m away
from the permanent lanes, with all soil-engaging components lifted clear of
the soil. This was carried out immediately before seeding the site normally,
travelling on the permanent lanes, leaving two seeded 0.48–0.65 m wide
“random” wheeltracks on the permanent beds.
This layout was used on all sites with minor variations depending on
grower equipment. It provided 2 sets of the 3 treatments with space for 4
replicate chambers (2 on each wheeltrack) with minimum additional traffic
damage to the long-term non-trafficked cropping beds of controlled traffic
farms. In all cases, the site was positioned on permanent traffic lanes that

			<td>GHG fluxes were measured using the closed chamber technique (Chadwick et al., 2014) and quality criteria as outlined by de Klein and
Harvey (2012), and Parkin and Venterea (2010). This method uses a gastight
chamber, which encloses a fixed surface area of soil for a given time
interval. The chamber consists of a frame driven 80–100 mm into the soil
and a headspace or lid that is fixed to the frame during sampling periods, but
removed at other times. Chamber enclosure is achieved by a sealed gasket at
the lower edge of the lid.
Chambers of 2 types were used during this work:
• Cylindrical chambers: these were 400 mm lengths of 220 mm diameter
plastic pipe, the bottom edge of which was chamfered on the outside to
facilitate insertion to a depth of 80–100 mm. Tight-fitting lids could be
installed during sampling periods, and these were fitted with a 4 mm
diameter pipe and on/off tap for gas sampling.
• Rectangular chambers: these had a 450 × 650 mm base, 100 mm deep,
fabricated from 2 mm stainless steel to fit the removable head spaces.
The head spaces were 50 l rectangular white plastic crates fitted with a
septum for gas sampling with a hypodermic syringe. Head spaces were
located on the base by stainless steel lugs and retained by strong elastic
cords to partially compress a 12 mm polyurethane foam sealing strip.
The rectangular chambers normally spanned at least one crop row.</td>

“random” wheeltrack was imposed on the permanent crop beds to mimic
traffic impact in non-controlled (random) traffic farming. This was installed
during the seeding operation, when growers were asked to make a single
tractor and seeder unit pass along a 50 m length of crop bed, 0.8-1.0 m away
from the permanent lanes, with all soil-engaging components lifted clear of
the soil. This was carried out immediately before seeding the site normally,
travelling on the permanent lanes, leaving two seeded 0.48–0.65 m wide
“random” wheeltracks on the permanent beds.
This layout was used on all sites with minor variations depending on
grower equipment. It provided 2 sets of the 3 treatments with space for 4
replicate chambers (2 on each wheeltrack) with minimum additional traffic
damage to the long-term non-trafficked cropping beds of controlled traffic
farms. In all cases, the site was positioned on permanent traffic lanes that
would not be required for in-crop spraying or fertiliser spreading operations,

			<td>GHG fluxes were measured using the closed chamber technique (Chadwick et al., 2014) and quality criteria as outlined by de Klein and
Harvey (2012), and Parkin and Venterea (2010). This method uses a gastight
chamber, which encloses a fixed surface area of soil for a given time
interval. The chamber consists of a frame driven 80–100 mm into the soil
and a headspace or lid that is fixed to the frame during sampling periods, but
removed at other times. Chamber enclosure is achieved by a sealed gasket at
the lower edge of the lid.
Chambers of 2 types were used during this work:
• Cylindrical chambers: these were 400 mm lengths of 220 mm diameter
plastic pipe, the bottom edge of which was chamfered on the outside to
facilitate insertion to a depth of 80–100 mm. Tight-fitting lids could be
installed during sampling periods, and these were fitted with a 4 mm
diameter pipe and on/off tap for gas sampling.
• Rectangular chambers: these had a 450 × 650 mm base, 100 mm deep,
fabricated from 2 mm stainless steel to fit the removable head spaces.
The head spaces were 50 l rectangular white plastic crates fitted with a
septum for gas sampling with a hypodermic syringe. Head spaces were
located on the base by stainless steel lugs and retained by strong elastic
cords to partially compress a 12 mm polyurethane foam sealing strip.
The rectangular chambers normally spanned at least one crop row.</td>

			<td>GHG fluxes were measured using the closed chamber technique (Chadwick et al., 2014) and quality criteria as outlined by de Klein and
Harvey (2012), and Parkin and Venterea (2010). This method uses a gastight
chamber, which encloses a fixed surface area of soil for a given time
interval. The chamber consists of a frame driven 80–100 mm into the soil
and a headspace or lid that is fixed to the frame during sampling periods, but
removed at other times. Chamber enclosure is achieved by a sealed gasket at
the lower edge of the lid.
Chambers of 2 types were used during this work:
• Cylindrical chambers: these were 400 mm lengths of 220 mm diameter
plastic pipe, the bottom edge of which was chamfered on the outside to
facilitate insertion to a depth of 80–100 mm. Tight-fitting lids could be
installed during sampling periods, and these were fitted with a 4 mm
diameter pipe and on/off tap for gas sampling.
• Rectangular chambers: these had a 450 × 650 mm base, 100 mm deep,
fabricated from 2 mm stainless steel to fit the removable head spaces.
The head spaces were 50 l rectangular white plastic crates fitted with a
septum for gas sampling with a hypodermic syringe. Head spaces were
located on the base by stainless steel lugs and retained by strong elastic
cords to partially compress a 12 mm polyurethane foam sealing strip.
The rectangular chambers normally spanned at least one crop row.</td>

during the seeding operation, when growers were asked to make a single
tractor and seeder unit pass along a 50 m length of crop bed, 0.8-1.0 m away

grower equipment. It provided 2 sets of the 3 treatments with space for 4
replicate chambers (2 on each wheeltrack) with minimum additional traffic
damage to the long-term non-trafficked cropping beds of controlled traffic

(50 cm × 50 cm × 15 cm) were fixed on stainless steel frames
inserted 80 mm into the soil. The lids of the chamberswere opened and closed automaticallywith

In addition to the automated chamber analysis, manual static
chamber analysis of GHG flux was completed in PL-biochar plots
only (n = 4 chambers per plot).

An additional static chamber was located in each plot where
autochambers were located (i.e. urea, PL and PL-biochar + urea) to
elucidate the source of N2O production. Following sowing, 10 atom%
15N-urea (supplied by Icon Isotopes, USA) was applied at 116 units
N/ha (within the static chamber ring), a rate which matched N addition
from the bulk plots. In urea amended plots, non-isotopically labelled
urea was excluded from within the static chambers, replaced instead
with 15N-urea at matching N rates. At weekly intervals following
amendment, samples were collected from static chambers using a
60 min incubation.</td>
			<td>Measurement of
N2O was performed using a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron
capture detector (ECD). To avoid interference with detection of
N2O, the CO2 was first scrubbed from the sample using an Ascarite®
filter. Methane was analysed by FID, whilst CO2 was monitored continuously
with an infrared gas analyser (LI-COR 820, LICOR, Lincoln/USA).
At the beginning and the end of the study standard curves were developed
for the ECD using several different standard concentrations (N2O;
0.1, 1.0 and 10 ppmv) to confirm the linearity range of the detector.
During the field campaign, samples within the linearity range were
calibrated automatically after every fifth sample using an ISO17025 certified
gas standard (Coregas,Yennora, Australia) of 0.5 ppmv.

For auxilliary measurements with manual chamber, gas
samples (25 mL) were collected using a gas tight glass syringe with
Teflon plunger (SGE Australia) and placed in evacuated 12 mL
Exetainer® vials. Analysis of the gas sample and calculation of flux
were described in Van Zwieten et al. (2010).

For additional static chamber for urea study, Gas samples (25 mL) were taken using a gas tight
glass syringe fitted with a Teflon plunger (SGE Australia) and placed
in evacuated 12 mL Exetainer® vials. Two samples were taken from
each static chamber, one for GHG analysis (method in Van Zwieten
et al. (2010)), the other for analysis by Isotope Ratio MS. Vials were
carefully packaged and sent to the University of California, Davis stable
isotope facility for 15N·N2O-analysis by a Thermo Scientific Delta V
Plus® isotope-ratio mass spectrometer using a Thermo Finnigan
GasBench + PreCon trace gas concentration system(Bremen, Germany).
The atom% 15N inN2O was calculated according to formulae provided by
Stevens et al. (1993).</td>
			<td>Methane fluxes were negligible and not further mentioned in the study's results. "Methane flux centred around zero with either small uptake or emissions. As a result the Pearson's correlation criteria often failed. This suggests
that CH4 flux was not important in this system and is not further
discussed."

Each functional location within each plot received one of thefollowing three treatments; WS = walnut shell biochar, PC = pine chip biochar or control = no amendment. Immediately prior to falltillage and cover crop seeding on November 6th, 2010 biochar wasapplied manually at a rate of 10 Mg ha−1or approximately 0.5%,w/w based on 10,000 kg ha−1incorporated to depth of 15 cm witha bulk density of 1.5 for the berm. On the same day of biochar application,  a final pass was used to pile tilled soil under vines to create aberm and bury the berm biochar.

All synthetic fertilization and irrigation was delivered via hang-ing drip; 1268 L and 2534 L of irrigation were applied per vine inyear one and two, respectively. Only the berm functional loca-tion received irrigation inputs. All irrigation occurred between themonths of April and October; more than double the amount ofirrigation water was applied in year two due to a regional drought.</td>

these grew onion, carrot and spinach in turn. The onions were
direct sown in 2003 and 2004 and planted from onion sets in 2005.
On each field, the treatments SCTF and RTF were compared in a
randomized block design with four blocks. The plots were 6.30-m

In the seasonal-controlle traffic (SCTF) treatment, the machinery was automatically guided
over fixed traffic lanes using tractor guidance based on RTK-DGPS
with aprecisionofabout2 cm. Thedistance betweenthe traffic lanes
was 3.15m. For crops with 50 cm and 75 cm row spacing, the
distance between the rows next to the traffic lanes was increased by
15 cm to avoid effects of the compacted lane on crop growth.

duringharvest, the fieldswere conventionally ploughedto a depth of
about 17 cmto alleviate topsoil compaction. Theworking width per

The RTF system treatment was based on the use of standard
tractors in spring. Tractors used for seedbed preparation and sowing
in green pea, spinach and onionswere selected such that they could
operate with 0.5 bar tyre pressure. The random traffic farming (RTF) system was realized on

these grew onion, carrot and spinach in turn. The onions were
direct sown in 2003 and 2004 and planted from onion sets in 2005.
On each field, the treatments SCTF and RTF were compared in a
randomized block design with four blocks. The plots were 6.30-m
wide and 80-m long.

In the seasonal-controlle traffic (SCTF) treatment, the machinery was automatically guided
over fixed traffic lanes using tractor guidance based on RTK-DGPS
with aprecisionofabout2 cm. Thedistance betweenthe traffic lanes
was 3.15m. For crops with 50 cm and 75 cm row spacing, the
distance between the rows next to the traffic lanes was increased by
15 cm to avoid effects of the compacted lane on crop growth.
Crops, which would normally be sown on 25 and 12.5 cm distance,
were sown at a closer distance of 24 and 10.8 cm, respectively, to
maintainthenumber of croprows inthe field while providing 53and
44 cm wide traffic lanes, respectively. The main tractor was a
140 kW four-wheel drive, fitted with 30-cm wide rubber tracks to
increase tractor stabilityand to avoid lateral slippage underwetfield
conditions (Fig. 2). The traffic lanes were used for seedbed
preparation, sowing/planting, liquid manure application in spring
and formechanical weed control. The working width was 6.30m for
most operations but the 75-cm wide ridges for carrots were made
with 3m wide equipment (Fig. 1). In autumn, after random traffic
duringharvest, the fieldswere conventionally ploughedto a depth of
about 17 cmto alleviate topsoil compaction. Theworking width per
plough bottom was 45 cm.
The RTF system treatment was based on the use of standard
tractors in spring. Tractors used for seedbed preparation and sowing
in green pea, spinach and onionswere selected such that they could
operate with 0.5 bar tyre pressure. The random traffic farming (RTF) system was realized on

Paper Waste Treatment:
Paper mill waste was applied at three different rates. The
waste was acquired from GB Papers Ltd, Guardbridge, St
Andrew, Fife in several batches and stockpiled in the field
without mixing.At Mackies field, waste treatments were applied to the previous
crop residues using a rear delivery manure spreader on
10 October 1994. This paper waste was applied at a 0, 12.7
(S.D. = 8.8) and 44.4 (7.1) t DMiha (WO, W1 and W2 respectively).
The distribution of paper waste was uniform up to
one metre from the centre line of the spreader. Insufficient
waste was available for complete application of both W1 and
W2 treatments, so W1 rates were located 2.5 m from the
centre line of the W2 treatments.

Cultivation treatment
We considered that the paper mill waste might adversely
affect subsequent crop yields, so we included the effect of cultivation
depth in the experimental design. We expected that
shallower waste incorporation would lead to the risk of N
shortage for the following crop, and that denitrification of
excess mineral nitrate might be promoted by incorporation
by deep cultivation.Three cultivation subtreatments to incorporate
the waste were applied perpendicular to the paper
waste treatments. Deep mouldboard ploughing (DP) inverted
the plough layer to about 350 mm depth, conventional
mouldboard ploughing (CP) inverted the plough layer to
about 150 mm depth, and reduced cultivation with a power
harrow (R) disturbed the surface soil to a nominal depth of
about 50 mm.

Crop residue treutment
Crop residues, which may constitute 30-40% of the previous
crop dry matter, remained on the plots. Residues were
removed on small subplots of the WO and W2 treatments. In
Mackies field, the measured lettuce crop residue returns
were 1.6 t DMiha at 5.3O/0 N. In Dipper field, the measured
calabrese residue returns were 5.4 t DMiha at 2.0% N.
Mineral N content of the soil was measured on 30 September
to 7 October 1994 at Mackies. It was 59 mg Nikg
(S.D = 56 mgikg) for the WO treatment and 114 (29) for the

studying the long-term effects of conventional versus
integrated cropping systems on crop productivity

			<td>The experimental design chosen for this study was a
two-factor split plot with four replicates, with depth of
primary tillage and nitrogen fertilization rate as the
two factors. The factor assigned to the main plot was
the depth of primary tillage, with two levels: tillage by
ploughing (P) (at 30 cm deep) and minimum tillage
with disk harrow (MT) (at 10 cm deep). Specifically, P
was performed in the fields originally assigned to the
conventional system in CIMAS, while MT was carried
out in the fields assigned to the integrated system. The
factor assigned to the sub-plot was the N fertilization
rate, with three levels: zero fertilization (N0),
110 kg N ha-1 (N1) and 170 kg N ha-1 (N2). The
size of each experimental unit (plot) was 5 m 9 6 m.

Primary tillage was performed at the beginning of
September in both years for both tillage levels, after
the clover harvest. The seed bed was prepared in both
years by double harrowing around 1 week before the
sowing date. Sowing was performed with a sowing
rate of 300 seeds m-2 on 26 Nov 2013 in the first year
and on 4 Nov 2014 in the second year. On this
occasion, 92 kg P2O5 ha-1 were supplied.
Nitrogen fertilizers were applied manually in three
split broadcasting applications during each growing
season: at sowing as urea on 26 Nov 2013 and 26 Nov
2014 (N1 and N2: 36 kg N ha-1); at tillering as
ammonium nitrate on 8 Mar 2014 and 20 Jan 2015
(N1: 37 kg N ha-1, N2: 67 kg N ha-1); and at stem
elongation as urea on 9 Apr 2014 and 6 Mar 2015 (N1:
37 kg N ha-1, N2: 67 kg N ha-1). The harvest was
performed on 30 Jun 2014 in the first year and on 6 Jul
2015 in the second year. After wheat harvest the straw
was removed from the field.</td>

The manual
chamber consisted of a square stainless-steel base (0.5m

edge and a cover box with aluminium frames and plastic panels
covered with a layer of white film (50cm L50cm W55cm
H). The chamber cover box was fitted with a sampling outlet in
the middle of the top panel, a mini fan inside the top panel for
mixing air and a closed-cell foam seal under the bottom frame.

Automatic gas sampling chambers which could capture diurnal
variation in greenhouse gas fluxes were also deployed from
February 2006 to June 2009. Limited by the number of chambers
(nine in total as supplied) and the length of sampling lines, the
automatic chambers were installed only for the SR treatments in
Block III, with two replications per plot for the CT-SR-0N, NT-SR-
0N and NT-SR-90N treatments and three for the CT-SR-90N
treatment. The automatic chamber (Papen & Butterbach-Bahl,
1999) consisted of a stainless-steel base that was identical to the
manual chamber base, an extension (0.3m deep) and a cover box
(0.3m deep) with stainless-steel frames and two lids on the top
panel that can be opened and closed automatically at pre-set
intervals. Placement and management of the chamber bases were
similar to those described above for the manual chambers. The
chamber extension was used when the crop height exceeded
about 30 cm.</td>

the Netherlands) that was fitted with ECD, FID and
TCD detectors for measurement of N2O, CH4 and CO2 concentrations,
respectively. The gas samples passed through a
stainless-steel Porapak Q column using N2 as the carrier gas
(50mLmin1) to separate N2O, and through Porapak N and
molecular sieve columns using He as the carrier gas
(36mLmin1) to separate CO2 and CH4.

For automatic chambers, air samples were automatically extracted from the
head-space of the chamber into a gas chromatograph fitted with
ECD and FID detectors (SRI 8610C, SRI Instruments, CA,Torrance,
USA) that analysed simultaneously the concentrations ofN2Oand
CH4 on-site.</td>

			<td>Between February 2003 and October 2005, four
experiments were carried out at two sites of contrasting
soil type to measure the impact of immediate
incorporation of solid manures on direct emissions of
NH3 and N2O and on subsequent uptake of manure-N
by a cereal crop. Immediate incorporation was
achieved by having a tractor with incorporation
implement on standy so the manure could be incorporated
within a few minutes of completing manure
application. The experiments tested four types of solid
manure, cattle farmyard manure (FYM), pig FYM,
layer manure and broiler litter. The four application
treatments were as follows:
1. Manure left on surface.
2. Immediate incorporation by plough.
3. Immediate incorporation by disc.
4. Immediate incorporation by spring tine.

are given in Webb et al. (2014). Manures were applied
at rates intended to apply 250 kg/ha N based on
standard analysis of livestock manures (Anon 2010).
There was an additional control plot (no manure
applied and no cultivation) in each block to provide
estimates of background direct N2O emissions and
crop N uptake without manure application, giving a
total of 17 plots per block. Each of the 17 treatments
was replicated four times in a randomised block design
with treatments applied to each block in successive
weeks in order to allow efficient use of resources, e.g.
wind tunnels to measure NH3.

losses for each treatment from each site where the manures were

experimental plots (F1, F2, F3, F4; 80 m2) contain three microplots
[3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP), dicyandiamide
(DCD), Control] with one chamber in the centre of each centre

For each experiment three microplots (5×4 m) were
established inside larger experimental plots (10×8 m) with four
replicates. In one set of experiments, the NIs DMPP and DCD were formulated on fertilizer granules of ammonium sulphate nitrate
(ASN; 26% N, 18.5% NH4
+-N and 7.5% NO3
–-N; DMPP
~1.6% relative to NH4
+-N and DCD ~16% relative to NH4
+-N)
and manually applied in springtime with summer barley (Hordeum
vulgare L.; 12 March 1997) in 1997 (90 kg ASN-N ha–1;
24 March 1997), maize (Zea mays L.; 4 May 1998) in 1998
(160 kg ASN-N ha–1; 5 May 1998) and with winter wheat (Triticum
aestivum L.; 20 November 1998) in 1999 (180 kg ASN-N
ha–1; 18 March 1999) in one dose. ASN without NI was used as a
control. The amounts of N applied each year were given by the
running experimental design. In the second group of experiments,
the NIs were applied in concentrations similar to those of the fertilized
plots but without N fertilizers (in 1997 1.0 g DCD m–2,
0.11 g DMPP m–2; in 1998 1.8 g DCD m–2, 0.18 g DMPP m–2; in
1999 1.9 g DCD m–2, 0.2 g DMPP m–2). In 1997 DMPP and DCD
dissolved in water were applied during springtime to summer barley
during vegetative growth (Hordeum vulgare L.; 12 March
1997) using a knapsack sprayer, whereas in 1998 (25 March 1998)
to vetch (Vicia sativa; 18 March 1998) as well as in 1999 to winter
wheat (Triticum aestivum L.; 20 November 1998); these NIs were
applied formulated on fertilizer granules of only triple super phosphate (TSP). The formulated fertilizer granules (ASN, TSP) with
DMPP and DCD were obtained from BASF (BASF Agricultural
Centre, Limburgerhof, Germany).</td>

cropping periods (1997–1999) by use of a closed-chamber method
(Hutchinson and Mosier 1981). At each experimental site (four
replicate plots) self-made steel chambers (40×40 cm) were permanently
implanted 10 cm into the soil. The gas flux measurements
were performed in such a way that gas emission could only be
quantified from soil but not from plants. Results obtained by
Chang et al. (1998) provided evidence that N2O can be directly
emitted by plants. To avoid this artifact, gas sampling plots were
kept fallow. However, the chambers were installed adjacent to the
plants in order to account for any rhizosphere effect on soilderived
gas emissions.</td>
			<td>Gas samples were collected twice weekly
between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m from the chamber atmosphere using
50-ml disposable syringes (Becton Dickinson, Ireland) at 0, 10
and 20 min after covering. All gas samples were analysed using a
gas chromatograph (Perkin Elmer Autosystem XL B5902). The
gas chromatography system was designed for the simultaneous
analysis of N2O and CO2 with an electron capture detector (ECD),
as well as that of CH4 with a flame ionization detector, in the same
sample. The fluxes of N2O (g N2O-N ha–1 day–1, n=4), CO2
(g CO2-C ha–1 day–1, n=4) and CH4 (g CH4-C ha–1 day–1, n=4)

			<td>In October 2003 three alley tillage/cover crop
treatments were established, using three blocks in an RCBD. As a result
of superimposition on the rootstock experiment, within each alley
treatment-block combination there were 6 subplots divided among the
3 rootstocks, with 2 replications per rootstock. The subplots had 2
measured vines, so that a total of 108 data vines were monitored for
pruning weights and harvest weights starting in Oct. 2003. Further
biomass measurements and all gas emissions during the 6th to 8th years
of the alley treatment experiment (all of 2009 and 2010) were carried
out on a single rootstock (V. riparia x V. rupestris cv 101-14 Mgt), which
represented intermediate vigor.
The alley treatments consisted of 1) a minimum-tilled dwarf barley
(Hordeum depressum cv UC603) cover crop treatment disked to a depth
of 2–3 cm every second fall to aid planting and establishment of the
cover crop, and mowed but not tilled in spring, where the chopped
residues of grapevine prunings and cover crops were left on the surface;
2) a barley cover crop under conventional tillage for which soil was
disked to a depth of approximately 10 cm in the fall prior to planting
the cover crop, and mowed and disked twice in the spring to incorporate
residues; and 3) a conventional tillage treatment where resident
annual weeds were mowed and disked twice to approximately
10 cm depth in the spring, which continued the soiĺs previous use.
Investigation with a metal rod after disking showed no difference in Ap
horizon depth between once-annual and twice-annual tillage. Directly
below the Ap horizon repeated disking created a thin, high-density,
corrugated soil layer. Cover crop roots rarely penetrated past 25 cm of
depth. Floor management implements were those commonly used in
regional winegrape vineyards, consisting of a tandem disk, a seed drill
and a flail mower. Tillage dates were 4/1/09, 5/8/09, 10/26/09, 3/22/

rootstock.

N2O and CH4 emissions were measured using static chambers positioned
in the alley centers and drip zone centers at maximum distance
from vine trunks. The chambers were generally in conformity with recommendations
by Parkin et al. (2003) and consisted of 20.3 cm diameter
PVC rings 11 cm high placed over 8 cm PVC collars with one
beveled outer edge, inserted 5 cm into the soil. Chambers had manual
mixing fans and a stretchable rubber sleeve that closed over the collars.
They were covered with aluminum insulation to reflect radiation and to
moderate temperature change inside the chamber.</td>
			<td>CO2: Effluxes were measured between 14:30 and 16:00 using an
infrared gas analyzer (LI-6400/09, LiCor Inc., Lincoln, NE). To describe
emissions from the drip zone, monthly measurements were made
during 2010. After each gas flux measurement, samples for gravimetric
soil moisture were taken approximately 60 cm from the collar at
0–20 cm using a soil auger.

N2O, CH4: Samples of gas taken from the chamber using a 20-mL syringe were
injected and stored in 12-mL tubes (Exetainer®, Labco Limited,
Buckinghamshire UK) with silicone sealant placed over the septum
before evacuation down to 50 mTorr. Extensive testing revealed that
positively pressurized Exetainers gave consistent GC readings in
second-round testing, while limiting sample contamination after collection.
The gas was analyzed for N2O using a 63Ni electron capture
detector (ECD) and for CH4 using a flame ionizing detector (FID), both
on the same gas chromatograph (GC-2014, Shimadzu Inc., Kyoto,

10 min without being touched to mix the gases inside the chamber,
and then the gases were collected with a 50 mL plastic syringe
equipped with a three-passage valve at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 min.
The greenhouse gas samples were analysed in Jiangsu Provincial
Key Lab for Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Mitigation. An Agilent
7890A gas chromatography (Agilent Technologies, Delaware, USA)
was used to determine the CO2 concentration. The standard CO2
concentration was 343 mg.L-1, and it was obtained from Nanjing
Shangyuan Industrial Gas Company. The chromatography working
parameters are listed below. The following conditions were used
for the CO2 detector: FID detection temperature, 300 C; chromatography
column, SS-2 m x 2 mm x Porapak Q (60/80); column
temperature, 50C; converter, nickel catalyst, 375 C; carrier gas,
pure dinitrogen (flow rate 25 cm3 min-1); inflammable gas,
hydrogen (flow rate 45 cm3 min-1); and air (flow rate
400 cm3 min-1) retention time, 1.40 min.</td>

For treatment CB150, Meister urea 10, a POCU (Chisso, Japan), was used as N fertilizer. This POCU fertilizer releases urea linearly for about 100 days at 20°C. Properties of the POCU are detailed in Fujita and Shoji (1999). The POCU was applied at 150 kg N/ha as basal fertilizer and was banded to 5 cm depth under the maize row prior to maize transplanting. For treatment UB150, conventional urea at 75 kg N/ha was banded at 8 cm depth beside the maize row prior to maize transplanting, and 24 days later, another 75 kg N/ha was applied to the soil surface between rows and then incorporated into the plough layer soil by a cultivator. This treatment is the one most widely adopted by farmers in this region. For treatment UI250, conventional urea at 125 kgN/ha was broadcast onto the soil surface and then incorporated into the plough layer before transplanting. Twenty-four days later, supplementary urea at 125 kg N/ha was applied to the soil surface between rows and then incorporated into the plough layer soil by a cultivator.
